# scratch-nn
Neural network from scratch using numpy in python. (Sorry, I did not write a neural network in Scratch)

I did this project because I felt like I didn't really know what was going on under the hood when I was first learning about machine learning. Many online resources start you off using PyTorch or Tensorflow, so you don't understand on a mathematical level what is actually going on in a networkâ€”personally, having this level of insight has helped me diagnose problems in more complicated projects that do use high-performance ML frameworks. I think everyone who wants a good intro to machine learning should do this as an exercise, and I'm currently working on a tutorial to walk a beginner through this. 

This is a one-hidden-layer fully connected neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. After 20 epochs of training the test accuracy was around 80%.

The hardest part about this project was computing the gradients by hand.
